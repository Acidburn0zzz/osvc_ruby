# OSCRuby

Still developing this; will let ya know when this happens.

The basic idea is to be able to do something simple like import a csv of information and post it into an Oracle Service Cloud site.

The ultimate goal is to use this gem to make a Rails app for advanced administration/development that cannot be done with Oracle Service Cloud alone

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'osc_ruby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install osc_ruby
